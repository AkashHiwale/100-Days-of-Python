# Hangman Game

Hangman is a word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it letter by letter. The guessing player has a limited number of guesses before the 'hangman' is completed. Each incorrect guess results in adding a part to the hangman diagram. The game ends when the guessing player correctly guesses the word or runs out of guesses. Enjoy the challenge of deducing the hidden word with each letter guessed!
